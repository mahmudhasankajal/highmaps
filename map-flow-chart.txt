1. Load Top level map (top for the currently logged in Admin) and set current level to top level

2. Load data for the above level (data points and report data from database)

3. When a point is clicked, show popup containing "Drill-down", "Show Details", "Go up" (drill-down and go-up will depend on the level. top-level won't have go-up, lowest level won't have drill-down).

4. When "Drill-down" or "Go up" is selected, get mapData and data from server and redraw the map.
